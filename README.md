# Dog vs. Cat Classification

In this project, I will tackle [Dog vs. Cat Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) using Convolutional Neural Network constructed with Tensorflow.

## Getting Started

First, please download jupyter notebook file from this repository to your local machine. Then, download training and testing database provided in the [Dog vs. Cat Kaggle competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data) to your local machine, in the same directory where you downloaded the jupyter notebook file.

### Prerequisites

You need run the jupyter notebook with the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
